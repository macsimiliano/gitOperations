Listen to me... pain is temporary
It may last for a minute
Or an hour 
Or a day or even a year
But eventually  it will sub side
And something else will take its place
If i quit however it will last forever..
Y'all spoiled some of y'all spoiled 
just bottom line 
Your parent have done everything for you
You never had to do nothing for yourself
You're spoiled we gon' keep it real tonight
some of you are spoiled brats.
Everytime you ever got in trouble somebody in your 
house got you out of it
Everytime you've done something you're not supposed
to do people say Eric your mother's a tyrant..you're right!
She kicked me out you're right 
She's mean but
She developed a man because she put me out there 
and said you gon'have to grow up and some of you 
haver never learned to grow up:
and so everytime something gets hard you QUIT you call momma
I dare you to take a little pain 
I dare you
I dare you not to go home
Somebody said, "I've gotta go home, I feel bad."
Go through it.
You ain't gonna die.
At the end of pain is success.
You're not going to die because you feel a little pain.
I'm not eating like I eat at home.
That's why you're about to go to the next level,...
...because if you keep eating like you eat at home,...
...you'll keep being a boy or a girl.
It's time to become man, woman.
But I'm exactly where I want to be,...
...because I realize I got to commit my very being to this thing.
I gotta breathe it, I gotta eat it, I gotta sleep it.
And until you get there, you'll never be successful in life.
But once you get there, I guarantee you the world is yours..
So, work hard and you can have whatever it is you want.
